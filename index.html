<h2>Hackathon Information</h2>
<p>
  This event aims at developing training materials in life sciences to be used in
  <a href="http://datacarpentry.org">Data Carpentry</a> workshops and
  other training that is using a similar teaching model. Data Carpentry workshops are aimed at
  researchers in the life sciences at all career stages. The workshops are designed to teach basic concepts, skills
  and tools for working more effectively with data. Data Carpentry workshops are an example-driven two-day workshops
  during which short tutorials alternate with hands-on practical exercises, and participants are encouraged
  both to help one another, and to try applying what they have learned to their own research problems during
  and between sessions. See the  <a href="http://datacarpentry.org/">Data Carpentry website</a> for more info. <br/></p>


<h2>Practical information</h2>

<h4>Accommodation</h4>
Participants should take care of their own travel and hotel  reservations. <em>PLEASE BOOK EARLY!</em> The city of Utrecht is host to the 
start of the Tour de France this year, which will take place a week  after the hackaton+workshop.
Below are three hotels that we often use (there are no hotels close to the campus). Of these three, 
the first one (Hotel NH Centre Utrecht) is  the nicest, as it is right in the middle of the historic town centre  with the busstop in front of it, which will take in you to the Utrecht 
campus in 15 minutes.
<ul>
<li>
<a href="http://www.nh-hotels.nl/hotel/nh-centre-utrecht">Hotel NH Centre Utrecht</a><br/>
Janskerkhof 10, 3512BL Utrecht, Tel. +31 30 231 3169
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.hotels.nl/utrecht/malie/">Malie Hotel</a><br/>
Maliestraat 2, 3581 SL Utrecht, Tel. +31 30 231 6424
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.hoteldeadmiraal.nl/index_en.html">Hotel De Admiraal</a><br/>
Admiraal van Gentstraat 11, 3572 XE Utrecht, Tel. +31 30 2758500
</li>
<h4> Transport</h4>
 From all these hotels you take bus 28 (or 128), direction "De Uithof  P+R" (aka "AZU") to get to the campus. Get off at busstop 
"Heidelberglaan".<br/>
Bus tickets are a bit tricky: you can buy tickets in the bus itself, but  they are quite expensive (2.40 euro per ride from city centre to the 
campus). The alternative is to buy an "OV chipcard" that you load with money and swipe when entering the bus and again when getting off it (the 
last bit is very important!).<br/>

<h2> Venue</h2>
<div>
The workshop will be held in room 2.112 of the 
<a href="https://www.google.nl/maps/@52.08636941,5.17699867,20z">Stratenum Building, Universiteitsweg 100, Utrecht</a>
</br>

The <a href="http://i.imgur.com/XprLoeP.png">closest bus stop is "Heidelberglaan"</a>, reachable by bus 12 from
Utrecht Central Station, or bus 28 coming from downtown. 

The route to room 2.112 will be sign-posted inside the 
<a href="http://i.imgur.com/9a6mF1V.jpg">Stratenum building</a>.

The (provisional) start time will be 9:00.

<h2>Participation</h2>
<p>This hackathon is primarily aimed at the ELIXIR project members. We invite all domain experts who are interested in and may already provide
  training in data handling; and who are willing to share their materials with a wider community. Participants with experience in running Data and
  Software Carpentry workshops are particularily encouraged to join. The <a href="#guidelines">contribution guidelines</a> provide more information
  on the work planned for the hackathon. <br/>
  The local ELIXIR Node Data and Software Coordinators will be contacting the potential participants directly but if you are interested in joining
  the event please contact <a href="mailto:aleksandra.pawlik@manchester.ac.uk">Aleksandra Pawlik</a>.</p>
  Participants are expected to bring their own laptop.


</p>

<h3>Suggested ideas and Scope of the hackathon</h3>

  There are many ways in which the participants can contribute to the
  development of new and the improvement of existing training materials for life
  sciences in Data Carpentry. The leading theme for this hackaton will be 
  genomics and next generation sequening. 
  

<!--
    <ul> Improve the current material:
      <li>make sure that <a href="https://github.com/datacarpentry/datacarpentry">current lessons</a>
	  have learning objectives and challenges associated with them so they
	  conform to the <a href="http://swcarpentry.github.io/lesson-template/">Software Carpentry lesson template</a>;</li>
      <li>take advantage of new measurements in
	<a href="https://github.com/datacarpentry/datacarpentry/tree/master/data/biology">mammal dataset</a>
	to include more plotting;</li>
      <li>refactor current <a href="https://github.com/datacarpentry/datacarpentry/tree/master/lessons/R">R lesson</a>
	to differentiate a little more from
	<a href="https://github.com/swcarpentry/r-novice-inflammation">the content included in Software Carpentry</a>.</li>
    </ul>


  <ul> Develop new material:
    <li> check <a href="https://github.com/datacarpentry/datacarpentry/issues">
	this list of proposed tasks / issues</a>
      and select the ones you are keen to work on.</li>
    <li> translate current lessons to use other datasets; these datasets should be publicly available
      (if they are going to be included in the Data Carpentry curriculum);
      it might worth developing a lesson around <a href="http://www.gapminder.org/data/">the Gapminder
	dataset</a> that is of general interest (for multidisciplinary workshop audiences).</li>
    <li> develop a new R lesson that uses <a href="http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/dplyr/vignettes/introduction.html">
	<em>dplyr</em></a>
      rather than base R for data manipulation.</li>
  </ul>



   <ul>
    <li> If you have your own datasets which you already use for teaching and you would be keen to share, we will provide detailed
      guidelines on how to do that during the Hackathon. Good datasets which are rich enough for teaching but not overwhelmingly
      large and freely available are  difficult to get.
    </li>
    <li> You may also chose to develop training materials for a particular tool
      used in data manipulation following the Data Carpentry model. We will
      provide a lesson template to help you structure the material. </li>
  </ul>

<h2>Hackathon organization & preparation</h2>
<p>
  By nature, Hackathons are relatively unstructured events.
  Participants will self-organize in teams centered around shared interests.
  At the beginning of the first day, participants will be encouraged to present (in 5 minutes or less) their idea(s) for projects they would like to work on.
  Depending on interests and ideas that overlap or intersect, teams will forms to work on some of these selected ideas.
  At the beginning of the second day, a representative of each team will report on their project.
  Teams are fluid. If someone wants to switch projects during the hackathon (e.g., because their expertise is needed for a short period of time) it's perfectly acceptable.
</p>

<p>
  We use GitHub to organize ideas and store the material being developed
  during the workshop.  If you don't already have one, please create a
  <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a> account. It's free and only
  takes a few seconds. 

  To participate in the hackaton, it is recommended that you be familiar
   with Git, but if you are not, you can make use of GitHub's <a
   href="https://github.com/data-lessons/2015-06-22-elixir-nl-sprint">web
   interface</a> or the <a
   href="https://github.com/data-lessons/2015-06-22-elixir-nl-sprint/wiki">wiki
   </a>

</p>

<p>
  To best prepare for the hackathon, it is a good idea to come with at least an idea of the kind of project you would like to work on.
  By <a href="https://github.com/datacarpentry/datacarpentry/issues/new">opening an issue</a> in the Data Carpentry Repository,
  you will let other people know of your ideas before the meeting. This will facilitate collaborations during the hackathon.
  Feel free to let people know that you are interested to work with them on a topic they proposed, or offer suggestions to their ideas.
  Be prepared to provide a 5 minute pitch of your idea during the first day of the hackathon.
